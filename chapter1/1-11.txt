Exercise 1-11
How would you test the word count program?
What kinds are most likely to uncover bugs if there are any?

- test with tabs, newlines, and spcaes
- test with empty input
- test with several spaces/tabs in a row
- test with and without a whitespace at the beginning/end

Likely to uncover bugs:

"abc" vs " abc "
"abc def" vs "abc \t def"
